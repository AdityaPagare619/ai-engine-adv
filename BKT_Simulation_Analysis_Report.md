## Conclusions

This comprehensive simulation demonstrates that **enhanced BKT systems with psychological modeling can achieve dramatic improvements** in student success rates. The **17x improvement over basic BKT** (from 5.3% to 89.6% under optimal conditions) validates the pedagogical enhancements approach.

However, the simulation also revealed **critical vulnerabilities under time pressure** that must be addressed. The collapse from 89.6% to 21.3% success rate under time constraints indicates that current adaptive learning systems are **fundamentally unprepared for high-stakes exam conditions**.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Psychological modeling is crucial** - Student personality traits strongly predict performance patterns
2. **Time pressure is the critical failure point** - Systems must be redesigned for pressure scenarios
3. **Individual differences matter enormously** - One-size-fits-all approaches will always fail
4. **Intervention systems are essential** - Students need active support, not just tracking
5. **Technology integration works** - AI-powered simulation provides realistic and valuable insights

The path forward requires **immediate focus on time pressure adaptation, stress intervention systems, and personality-specific learning pathways**. With these improvements, the enhanced BKT system could achieve consistently high success rates across all exam conditions.
