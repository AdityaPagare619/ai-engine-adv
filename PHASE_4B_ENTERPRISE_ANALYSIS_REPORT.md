        self.error_model = SkillBasedErrorModel()
        self.engagement_model = TemporalEngagementModel()
        
    def simulate_3_month_learning(self, student_profile):
        """
        Simulate 3 months of realistic learning behavior:

- Implement continuous learning pipeline
- Complete production validation

### **Bottom Line:**
**The current implementation is a solid B+ foundation that could become an A+ enterprise system with focused effort on production readiness, fairness, and scalability.**
