**Notes:**
- Two implementations exist with slightly different approaches
- Both follow the core half-life regression principles

### 8. Calibration Engine

**Documentation Alignment:** ✅ COMPLETE
- Implementation uses Temperature Scaling as documented
- Maintains separate parameters per exam and subject
- Uses L-BFGS optimization as specified

**Files Verified:**
- `ai_engine/src/knowledge_tracing/calibration/calibrator.py`
- `ai_engine/src/knowledge_tracing/routes/calibration_route.py`

**Notes:**
- Implementation includes Expected Calibration Error calculation
- API routes for both fitting and applying calibration

## Integration Testing

The codebase includes comprehensive integration tests that verify the interaction between components:
- `ai_engine/tests/test_end_to_end.py`
- `ai_engine/test_multi_exam_integration.py`
- `phase4b_integrated_simulation_demo.py`

These tests confirm that the components work together as expected in realistic scenarios.

## Conclusion

All Phase 4 components are fully implemented according to the technical documentation. The implementation is comprehensive and includes additional features beyond the basic requirements in some cases.

### Recommendations

1. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Add details about the advanced fairness monitoring capabilities
   - Document the two different spaced repetition implementations and their use cases

2. **Code Improvements:**
   - Consider consolidating the two spaced repetition implementations
   - Add more comprehensive error handling in API routes

Overall, the implementation meets or exceeds the specifications in the technical documentation.
