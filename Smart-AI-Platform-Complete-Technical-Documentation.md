## AI Engine Components

### 1. Knowledge Tracing System (BKT - Bayesian Knowledge Tracing)

**Purpose:** Track student mastery of concepts over time

**Implementation:**
- **Algorithm:** Modified Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with context modifiers
- **Input:** Student responses, difficulty levels, time taken, stress indicators
- **Output:** Mastery probability (0-1) per concept/topic
- **Context Awareness:** Adjusts for stress, cognitive load, and time pressure

**Key Features:**
- Per-exam parameter tuning (JEE vs NEET vs Advanced)
- Real-time mastery updates after each question
- Prerequisite concept dependency modeling
- Performance prediction capabilities

**Code Location:** `ai_engine/src/knowledge_tracing/bkt/bkt_engine.py`

### 2. Stress Detection Engine

**Purpose:** Identify student stress levels from behavioral signals

**Multi-Modal Inputs:**
- **Response Time Patterns:** Unusual delays or rapid responses
- **Hesitation Metrics:** Time between question display and first interaction
- **Keystroke Dynamics:** Typing patterns and corrections
- **Performance Correlation:** Accuracy drops under time pressure

**Algorithm:**
- **Method:** Ensemble model combining statistical analysis and ML classification
- **Features:** Response time variance, hesitation duration, error patterns
- **Output:** Stress level (0-1), confidence score, intervention recommendations

**Thresholds:**
- **Low Stress (0-0.3):** Normal learning state
- **Moderate Stress (0.3-0.7):** Increased difficulty or time pressure
- **High Stress (0.7-1.0):** Potential intervention needed

**Code Location:** `ai_engine/src/knowledge_tracing/stress/detection_engine.py`

### 3. Cognitive Load Manager

**Purpose:** Assess mental workload and working memory capacity

**Based on Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory:**
- **Intrinsic Load:** Problem complexity relative to student knowledge
- **Extraneous Load:** Interface friction, distractions, poor presentation
- **Germane Load:** Effort dedicated to schema construction

**Calculation Formula:**
```python
total_load = intrinsic_load + extraneous_load + germane_load
overload_risk = 1 / (1 + exp(-3 * (total_load/capacity - 1)))
```

**Mobile-Aware Multipliers:**
- Interface complexity: +15% for mobile
- Time pressure: +10% for mobile
- Distraction level: +20% for mobile

**Code Location:** `ai_engine/src/knowledge_tracing/cognitive/load_manager.py`

### 4. Dynamic Time Allocator

**Purpose:** Recommend optimal time per question based on student state

**Input Factors:**
- Base time requirement (question difficulty)
- Current stress level
- Fatigue level (session duration)
- Mastery level for related concepts
- Exam-specific time constraints

**Time Calculation:**
```python
raw_factor = stress_factor * fatigue_factor * mastery_factor * difficulty_factor
final_time = min(base_time * raw_factor, exam_time_cap)
```

**Exam-Specific Caps:**
- **JEE Mains:** 180 seconds per question
- **NEET:** 90 seconds per question
- **JEE Advanced:** 240 seconds per question

**Code Location:** `ai_engine/src/knowledge_tracing/pacing/time_allocator.py`

### 5. Question Selection Engine

**Purpose:** Choose next-best question for optimal learning

**Multi-Armed Bandit Approach:**
- **Algorithm:** Pressure-Aware LinUCB
- **Reward Function:** Expected score per unit time
- **Feature Vector:** [difficulty, mastery, stress, load, scoring_scheme]
- **Exploration vs Exploitation:** Balanced using UCB algorithm

**Selection Strategy:**
```python
ucb_score = expected_reward + alpha * sqrt(uncertainty)
```

**Context Features:**
- Student mastery level
- Current stress and cognitive load
- Exam scoring scheme (+4/-1 vs +4/-2)
- Estimated time to complete
- Topic dependencies

**Code Location:** `ai_engine/src/knowledge_tracing/selection/pressure_linucb.py`

### 6. Fairness Monitoring System

**Purpose:** Detect and prevent algorithmic bias

**Monitored Metrics:**
- Mastery estimation accuracy by demographic groups
- Time allocation fairness across student segments
- Question selection bias detection
- Performance prediction accuracy

**Segmentation:**
- Geographic (urban vs rural)
- Device type (mobile vs desktop)
- Network quality (2G vs 4G+)
- Language preference

**Alert Thresholds:**
- **Low Priority:** Disparity > 5%
- **Medium Priority:** Disparity > 10%
- **High Priority:** Disparity > 15%

**Code Location:** `ai_engine/src/knowledge_tracing/fairness/monitor.py`

### 7. Spaced Repetition Scheduler

**Purpose:** Optimize review timing using forgetting curve

**Algorithm:** Half-Life Regression
```python
half_life = difficulty_factor * ability_modifier * recall_success_factor
next_review = last_seen + (half_life * spacing_interval)
```

**Factors:**
- Initial difficulty of concept
- Student's ability level
- Previous recall success rate
- Time since last exposure
- Stress and cognitive load context

**Integration:** Feeds back into question selection for "just-in-time" reviews

**Code Location:** `ai_engine/src/knowledge_tracing/spaced_repetition/scheduler.py`

### 8. Calibration Engine

**Purpose:** Ensure prediction probabilities are well-calibrated

**Method:** Temperature Scaling
- Maintains separate temperature parameters per (exam, subject)
- Prevents cross-exam probability contamination
- Uses L-BFGS optimization for temperature fitting

**Why Important:**
- Reliable confidence scores for UI decisions
- Accurate risk assessment for question selection
- Better threshold setting for interventions

**Code Location:** `ai_engine/src/knowledge_tracing/calibration/calibrator.py`
