feat: Complete Phase 2.2 - Monitoring, Load Testing & Frontend Integration

ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2.2 Features Completed:
âœ… Prometheus metrics integration with /metrics endpoint
âœ… Comprehensive monitoring middleware for Go service
âœ… Python asyncio simulation framework for load testing
âœ… Go concurrent simulation framework (alternative)
âœ… Minimal frontend prototype with real-time metrics
âœ… Grafana dashboard JSON for monitoring visualization
âœ… Extended test question dataset (46 questions across subjects)
âœ… Complete run guide with step-by-step instructions

ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:
- Added metrics package with atomic counters for thread-safety
- Implemented middleware for request tracking and duration metrics
- Created Python simulation with configurable concurrency/duration
- Built responsive frontend with Bootstrap and real-time API integration
- Enhanced monitoring with success rates, error tracking, and performance metrics

ðŸ“Š Load Testing Capabilities:
- Support for 50+ concurrent simulated students
- Realistic request patterns with delays and error handling
- CSV export of detailed metrics and performance data
- Configurable test scenarios (light/medium/heavy load)

ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Features:
- Question generation interface with subject/topic selection
- Answer submission with validation and feedback
- Real-time metrics dashboard showing service health
- Responsive design with Bootstrap styling

ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring & Metrics:
- Total requests, success/failure rates
- Response time tracking and active connections
- Question-specific metrics (generated, answered, validated)
- Prometheus-compatible format with Grafana integration

ðŸ”„ Ready for Phase 3:
- Comprehensive test coverage foundation
- Performance benchmarks established
- Monitoring infrastructure in place
- Scalable architecture patterns implemented

Files Added/Modified:
- internal/middleware/metrics.go (monitoring middleware)
- internal/metrics/metrics.go (Prometheus metrics)
- simulation/simulate_students.py (Python load testing)
- simulation/simulate_students.go (Go load testing)
- frontend/ (complete frontend prototype)
- monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json (dashboard config)
- testdata/extended_questions.csv (test dataset)
- PHASE_2_2_RUN_GUIDE.md (comprehensive documentation)
